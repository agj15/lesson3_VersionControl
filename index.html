            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A free and open source distributed version control system that is designed to handle projects ranging from small to large. It tracks changes in computer files, while simultaneously coordinating work on those exact files to multiple people. The basic Git commands include commit, push, pull, and clone, just to name a few. This topic interests me because this current program I am using is synced with GitHub. It seems beneficial in every computing situation and it is important to having a working copy of your code. It is one of the main version control system sets, and Git is a very import asset to the process of transferring files.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The most common and simple type of version control system is copying files into another directory, although it is very prone to errors. Local Version Control Systems are there to help these issues, with a very simple database that keep all the file changes under control. On the topic of local, local repositories are repositories that resides on a local machine of an individual user. These can be created in two ways. One being, creating a brand new repository. The second is by cloning an existing remote repository onto your local machine. Local version control systems control both the local repository and a remote repository relating them to one another. This interests me but I am curious to learn more and gain a better understanding of the relevance to the course.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A data structure that a Git stores its information in. It is just a central location for all the information. When it comes to recording changes to the repository, you need to remember that each file in the working directory can be either tracked or untracked. Track files can be unmodified, modified or staged. Basically, tracked files are files that Git knows about. But everything else is considered untracked. Untracked files are any files in the working directory that were not in the staging area.When a repository is first cloned, all of the files will be tracked and unmodified because Git just checked them out and nothing has been edited.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When you have one main repository that houses and keeps all of your project files. When you have multiple team members, they will check files out and make changes to their copy and then check the file/project in (called commit) to the single or main repository that mostly houses all of the versions. The version control is a server and the versions are desktops and/or developers. Using a version control comes with many advantages. One of the main advantages is that it solves the file sharing problem where you could have your team members overriding others work. I believe that is what makes this term interesting and useful, it is especially relevant to our Web Application course and has many uses.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Version Control System (VCS) automaticaly does a few things. It notes who changed the files, aka revision history, it notes when they were changed, what about them was new or different, and it merges the changes to the same file. Version control systems cannot be overwritten. There is a common repository that holds all the latest files. People can work on the same files simultaneously without conflict. VCS allow you to revert back to an older version of the file if you need. You do not even need to work with a team, the VCS system will still backup your files so that you won't lose your work or have to start a next project. This is extremely helpful to those in need and will keep the files even when times get messy. This topic interests me greatly.</p>
